# protein-viewer
Using matplotlib and Panda3D for viewing proteins through their PDB archives.

This project has as an objective using different libraries for viewing 3D protein models.

The libraries are:

· Mathematical library, matplotlib

· Videogame engine library, Panda3D

MATPLOTLIB

Execute the command python matviewer.py data/1yd9.pdb

4 possible modes: cpk, aminoacid, backbone and dssp

PANDA3D

Execute the command python pandaviewer.py data/1yd9.pdb for the example

Commands are:

1: CPK

2: Aminoacid type

3: Backbone

4: DSSP

c: chain cloud

Up arrow key: Vertical rotation

Down arrow key: Stop rotation

(Camera is a bit wonky) Left click for panning

Middle click for rotation 1

Right click for zooming
